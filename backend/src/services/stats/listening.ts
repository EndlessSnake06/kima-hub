/**
 * What a person's listening actually looks like, in numbers.
 *
 * ## Why time is an estimate, and how honest an estimate it is
 *
 * A play row records who, what and when — not how long. So total listening
 * time is derived: every play is credited its track's full length.
 *
 * That is defensible only because of what a play now means. Since 1.10.1 a
 * play is recorded when somebody heard at least half the track (or four
 * minutes, whichever is less), so the multiplier is applied to real listening
 * rather than to clicks. The estimate still reads high — we charge you the
 * whole song when we know you heard at least half of it — but the error is
 * bounded and small for normal-length music.
 *
 * It is NOT bounded for long tracks. The rule caps its requirement at four
 * minutes, so a forty-five minute live set counts after four. Crediting the
 * full length there would be wrong by a factor, not a percentage, so no single
 * play is credited more than `PLAY_CREDIT_CAP_SECONDS`. That one clamp is the
 * difference between an estimate that is a little generous and one that a
 * single DJ mix can double.
 *
 * Every number derived this way is labelled "about" in the interface. Say
 * estimate, mean estimate.
 *
 * ## Local time
 *
 * `playedAt` is a naive timestamp holding UTC. An hour-of-day chart in UTC is
 * meaningless to a person, so the caller passes an IANA zone and the bucketing
 * happens in their wall clock.
